  <h4>Face Mask Detection system built with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts in order to detect face masks in static images as well as in real-time video streams.</h4>

## Features
Our face mask detector didn't use any morphed masked images dataset. The model is accurate, and since we used the MobileNetV2 architecture, itâ€™s also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.

## Dataset
The dataset used can be downloaded  [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XDte2DL2Mf_hw4NsmGst7QtYoU7sMBVG?usp=sharing)

This dataset consists of __3835 images__ belonging to two classes:
*	__with_mask: 1916 images__
*	__without_mask: 1919 images__

The images used were real images of faces wearing masks. The images were collected from the following sources:
* __Kaggle datasets__ 
* __RMFD dataset__ ([See here](https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset))
